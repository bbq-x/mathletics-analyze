File Additions
    - Stats_Builder uses expand and creates rolling averages, helpers.schedule_stat might have same logic
        - This exported ppg charts for all teams
        - helpers.schedule_stat returns a df, probably with anticipation of creating visualizations
    - Histogram has some ppg code
    - Possession_Calculator has better histograms than Histogram and it has boxplots

PPG Questions
    - Does ppg decrease over the course of a season?
        Visuals will help but not practical for analyzing all 30 teams
        Is there a way to t-test this to put in a table?
        Show raw points scored for each game, averages will be skewed over the season
            Remove Cup championship before expanding game #'s
        Mean and median of each game #
    - Does home/away matter?
    - Do referees matter?

Win Questions -- 'win' is defined as positive +/-
    - Does possession efficiency matter?
