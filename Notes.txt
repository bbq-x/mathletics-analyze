- Points are validated amongst game/player/rotations
    - Record builder indicates that points are true to reality

File Additions
    - Stats_Builder uses expand and creates rolling averages, helpers.schedule_stat might have same logic
        - This exported ppg charts for all teams
        - helpers.schedule_stat returns a df, probably with anticipation of creating visualizations
    - Histogram has some ppg code
    - Possession_Calculator has better histograms than Histogram and it has boxplots

PPG Questions
    - Does ppg decrease over the course of a season?
        Visuals will help but not practical for analyzing all 30 teams
        Is there a way to t-test this to put in a table?
    - Does home/away matter?
    - Do referees matter?

Win Questions -- 'win' is defined as positive +/-
    - Does possession efficiency matter?

- Group by season
    PPG u+/-  HPPG u+/-  APPG u+/-
